This is a program written in System Verilog designed for the Basys3 Artix-7 FPGA Board.

When loaded onto the board, a timer will begin and you, the player, have until the timer
reaches 0 to guess the password. The password is input via the switches on the board 
and you know how many bits you currently have correct by the number of LED's that are 
lit. There are 3 levels, shown via the leftmost seven segment display.

Good Luck!
